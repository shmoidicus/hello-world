Greetings!
I'm Shmoidicus - a strange species that lives on tea, biscuits and fudge. My preferred programming languages are Python and HTML, although when creating webpages I also can use CSS and JavaScript.

A quick note: nothing in any of the galaxies that I have ever visited tastes better than fudge. In my opinion, anyway.
